	- ORM stands for Object Relational Mapper
	- It gives the application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL

Explain about python modules like  requests, urllib, urllib2 and Differences between them?

Requests

	- Requests is a Python module that you can use to send all kinds of HTTP requests.
	- For Ex:
	import requests
	req = requests.get('https://www.edureka.co/')

Urllib

	- Urllib module is the URL handling module for python. It is used to fetch URLs (Uniform Resource Locators).
	-  It uses the urlopen function and is able to fetch URLs using a variety of different protocols.
	- For Ex:
	import urllib.request
	request_url = urllib.request.urlopen('https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/')
	print(request_url.read())

Urllib2

	- It defines functions and classes to help with URL actions (basic and digest authentication, redirections, cookies, etc)
	- For Example
	import urllib2
	f = urllib2.urlopen('http://www.python.org/')
	print f.read(100)

Difference between requestsm urllib and urllib2:

	- urllib and urllib2 are both Python modules that do URL request related stuff but offer different functionalities.

	1) urllib2 can accept a Request object to set the headers for a URL request, urllib accepts only a URL.

	2) urllib provides the urlencode method which is used for the generation of GET query strings, urllib2 doesn't have such a function. This is one of the reasons why urllib is often used along with urllib2.

	3) Requests - Requests’ is a simple, easy-to-use HTTP library written in Python.

What is web crawling?

	- It is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner.
