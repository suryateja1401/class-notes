Configuration Management
-------------------------

    - Configuration management is the process of maintaining software and computer systems (example servers, storage, networks) in a known, desired and consistent state.
    - It also allows access to an accurate historical record of system state for project management and audit purposes.
    - System Administrators mostly perform repetitive tasks like installing servers, configuring those servers, etc.,
    - These professionals can automate this task, by writing scripts.
    - However, it is a difficult job when they are working on a massive infrastructure.
    - The Configuration Management tool like a Puppet was introduced to resolve such issues.

Puppet
------

    - Puppet is an open source DevOps systems management tool for centralizing and automating the configuration management process.
    - It is used to configure, manage, deploy, and orchestrate various applications and services across the whole infrastructure of an organization.
    - Puppet is specially designed to manage the configuration of Linux and Windows systems.
    - It is written in Ruby and uses its unique Domain Specific Language (DSL) to describe system configuration.

    - Puppet Versions:

        - Puppet comes in two versions:

            1. Open Source Puppet:

                - It is a basic version of Puppet configuration management tool, which is also known as Open Source Puppet.
                - It is available directly from Puppet's website and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 system.

            2. Puppet Enterprise:

                - Commercial version that offers features like compliance reporting, orchestration, role-based access control, GUI, API and command line tools for effective management of nodes.

What Puppet can do?

    - Example:

        - You have an infrastructure with about 100 servers. As a system admin, it's your role to ensure that all these servers are always up to date and running with full functionality.
        - To do this, you can use Puppet, which allows you to write a simple code which can be deployed automatically on these servers.
        - This reduces the human effort and makes the development process fast and effective.

    - Puppet performs the following functions:

        - Puppet allows you to define distinct configurations for every host.
        - The tool allows you to continuously monitor servers to confirm whether the required configuration exists or not and it is not altered
        - If the config is changed, Puppet tool will revert to the pre-defined configuration on the host.
        - It also provides control over all the configured system, so a centralized change gets automatically effected.
        - It is also used as a deployment tool as it automatically deploys software to the system.
        - It implements the infrastructure as a code because policies and configurations are written as code.

Why Puppet?

    - Provisioning:

        - Easy deployment of application on large number of servers
        - Resources and their configurations can be defined at node level

    - Consistent:

        - Maintains consistency across nodes which means if any change is done locally, it is rolled back to the original configuration

    - Ecosystem:

        - Puppet provides the suitable ecosystem to support and meet the needs of any company irrespective of its size

    - Scalable:

        - Scaling across multiple teams and thousands of resources is easily done

Puppet DSL and Programming Paradigms:

    - Before we learn Puppet DSL, let's understand programming paradigms:

        - A programming paradigm is a style you are using in computer programming
        - Four types of paradigms are:

            - Imperative
            - Declarative
            - Functional (which is considered a subset of that declarative paradigm)
            - Object-oriented

        - We will focus on Imperative and Declarative.

        - Imperative:

            - This programming paradigm expresses the logic of a computation(What to do) and describes its control flow(How to do)
            - Example:

                - Assume you are going to your office, you book a cab and start giving step by step directions to the driver until you reach the office.
                - Specifying what to do and how to do is an imperative style.

        - Declarative:

            - This programming paradigm expresses the logic of a computation(What to do) without describing its control flow(How to do)
            - Example:

                - Assume you are going to your office, you book Uber cab and specify the final destination (Office).
                - Specifying what to do not how to do is a declarative style.

        - Puppet uses a declarative programming paradigm approach
        - Example:

            - Create a user on the system
            - It can be done using Imperative programming pattern by a shell script:

                - Here we specify how to create the user and what commands to use on the operating system

                    #!/bin/sh
                    for i in `more userlist.txt `
                    do
                    echo $i
                    echo $i | change -d 0 "$i"
                    echo; echo "User $i will be forced to change password on next login!"
                    done

                - However, it can be done using Declarative programming pattern with only a few lines of puppet code, Puppet domain specific language (DSL), and still achieve the same result.

                    user {
                    "puppetuser": ensure => "present"
                    }

Deployment models of configuration management tools:

    - There are two deployment models for configuration management tools:

        1. Push-based deployment model: Initiated by a master node

            - In this deployment model master server pushes the configurations and software to the individual agents.
            - After verifying a secure connection, the master runs commands remotely on the agents.
            - For example, Ansible and Salt Stack

        2. Pull-based deployment model: Initiated by agents

            - In this deployment model, individual servers contact a master server, verify and establish a secure connection, download their configurations and software and then configure themselves accordingly
            - For example, Puppet and Chef

How Puppet Works?

    - Puppet is based on a Pull deployment model, where the agent nodes check in regularly after every 1800 seconds with the master node to see if anything needs to be updated in the agent.
    - If anything needs to be updated the agent pulls the necessary puppet codes from the master and performs required actions.
    - Example:

        - The Master:

            - A Linux based machine with Puppet master software installed on it.
            - It is responsible for maintaining configurations in the form of puppet codes.
            - The master node can only be Linux.
            - It applies the configuration to nodes using the Puppet agent.

        - The Agents:

            - Puppet Agents are the actual working machines which are managed by the Puppet master
            - They have the Puppet agent daemon service running inside them.
            - The target machines managed by a puppet with the puppet agent software installed on them.
            - The agent can be configured on any supported operating system such as Linux or Windows or Solaris or Mac OS.
            - The communication between master and agent is established through secure certificates.

        - Communication between the master and agent:

            Step-1: (Agent Sends Facts to Master)

                - Once the connectivity is established between the agent and the master, the Puppet agent sends the data about its state to the Puppet master server.
                - These are called Facts: This information includes the hostname, kernel details, IP address, file name details, etc.…

            Step-2: (Master sends a catalog to Agent)

                - Puppet Master uses this data and compiles a list with the configuration to be applied to the agent.
                - This list of configuration to be performed on an agent is known as a "catalog".
                - This could be changed such as package installation, upgrades or removals, File System creation, user creation or deletion, server reboot, IP configuration changes, etc.

            Step-3: (Agent applies configuration)

                - The agent uses this list of configuration to apply any required configuration changes on the node.
                - In case there are no drifts in the configuration, Agent does not perform any configuration changes and leaves the node to run with the same configuration.

            Step-4: (Agents report back to master)

                - Once it is done the node reports back to puppet master indicating that the configuration has been applied and completed.

Keywords:
---------

    Facts:

        - Facts are the details related to the node or the master machine, which are basically used for analyzing the current status of any node.
        - On the basis of facts, changes are done on any target machine.
        - There are pre-defined and custom facts in Puppet.

    Catalog:

        - All the manifest files or configuration which are written in Puppet are first converted to a compiled format called catalog and later those catalogs are applied on the target machine.

    Config Repository:

        - This is the repo where all nodes and server-related configurations are saved and pulled when required.

Installation
============

    - Pre-requisites:

        - Master and Agent nodes should be connected and communicating
        - Every command should run as root
        - Setup ntp in master as well as hosts as follows:

            $ sudo apt install -y ntp ntpdate
            $ sudo ntpdate -u 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org
            $ sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
            $ sudo systemctl enable ntp
            $ sudo systemctl restart ntp

    - Setting up hosts:

        - Change the host name if need using the below command:

            $ hostnamectl set-hostname <new-name>

        - Example:

            $ hostnamectl set-hostname puppet-master

            $ hostnamectl set-hostname puppet-agent-1

        - Add the Puppet Server IP to all the server, naming it "puppet"

            $ nano /etc/hosts

        - Also add the IP address of the agent itself naming it "puppet-agent"

        - Example:

            root@osboxes:/home/osboxes# cat /etc/hosts
            127.0.0.1       localhost
            127.0.1.1       puppet-master

            192.168.56.110  puppet
            192.168.56.106  puppet-agent

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Puppet Server Setup:

        - Puppet Server manages all the agent nodes and is responsible for pushing configurations to them
        - It is only installed on the master machine
        - Download the puppet package for ubuntu using

            $ wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet-release-bionic.deb
            $ dpkg -i puppet-release-bionic.deb
            $ apt update
            $ apt install puppetserver

        - Configure memory allocation: (If Required)

            $ sudo nano /etc/default/puppetserver

            JAVA_ARGS="-Xms3g -Xmx3g -XX:MaxPermSize=256m"

        - Open the firewall

            $ sudo ufw allow 8140

        - Start Puppet server

            $ sudo systemctl start puppetserver

            $ sudo systemctl status puppetserver

            $ sudo systemctl enable puppetserver

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - Puppet Agent Setup:

        - Download and install the Puppet Package similar to the way in Puppet Server Setup

            $ wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet-release-bionic.deb
            $ dpkg -i puppet-release-bionic.deb
            $ apt update
            $ apt install puppet-agent

        - Open the firewall

            $ sudo ufw allow 8140

        - Start Puppet agent

            $ sudo systemctl start puppet

            $ sudo systemctl enable puppet

            $ sudo systemctl status puppet

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Signing Certificates on Puppet Master:

        - Running the puppet service on a Puppet Agent generates and sends a "certificate" signing request to the Puppet Server
        - The Master Node must sign the certificates in order to configure the Agent Nodes
        - To show the all the Unsigned Certificates on Puppet Server use cert list command

            $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list

        - There should be one request for each host you set up, that looks something like the following:

            - Output:

                "node1"  (SHA256) 46:19:79:3F:70:19:0A:FB:DA:3D:C8:74:47:EF:C8:B0:05:8A:06:50:2B:40:B3:B9:26:35:F6:96:17:85:5E:7C
                "node2" (SHA256) 9D:49:DE:46:1C:0F:40:19:9B:55:FC:97:69:E9:2B:C4:93:D8:A6:3C:B8:AB:CB:DD:E6:F5:A0:9C:37:C8:66:A0

    - Sign requests:

        - Certificates can be signed individually using sign command with the Agent Name

        - Syntax:

            $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname <node-name>

        - Example:

            $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign --certname node1

        - We’ll use the --all option to sign the remaining certificate:

            $ sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet cert sign --all

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Verifying the Installation:

        - List out all the signed node Certificates

            root@puppet-master:/tmp# sudo /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list --all
            Signed Certificates:
                puppet-master    (SHA256)  BB:96:B1:D1:34:CC:E9:D2:E5:0C:62:7C:D5:14:B6:DF:AB:58:B8:EE:78:62:B1:4F:E3:CC:9E:C2:EF:09:B6:70  alt names: ["DNS:puppet", "DNS:puppet-master"]

====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Puppet Blocks:
--------------

    - Puppet provides the flexibility to integrate Reports with third-party tools using Puppet APIs.
    - Four types of Puppet building blocks are:

        1. Resources
        2. Classes
        3. Manifest
        4. Modules

===========================
    - Puppet Resources:
===========================

        - Resources describe the state of the system
        - Resources are the inbuilt functions that run at the back end to perform the required operations in puppet.
        - In general, a system consists of files, users, services, processes, packages, etc.., These are called "Resources" in puppet
        - Resources are the fundamental building blocks in Puppet
        - All the operations on puppet agents are performed with the help of puppet resources.
        - Puppet resources are the readymade tools that are used to perform various tasks and operations on any supported platform.
        - We can use a single puppet resource to perform a specific task, or we can use multiple puppet resources together to perform some complex application configurations deployments.

        - Example: 1

            node default{ package {
            "git":
                ensure => "present"
            }

            }

            - Here, "package" is a resource, "git" is a resource-title and "ensure" is an attribute
            - Every resource has a set of attributes and every attribute has a set of values. Here, the value is "present"
            - Attributes provide description that Puppet uses to manage resource

        - Example: 2

            node default { user {"Naveen":
                            ensure => "present",
                            password => "12345"
            }
            }

            - Here, "user" is a resource and "Naveen" is a resource-title

        - Resources can have different types. Puppet uses resources and resource types in order to describe a system's configuration.
        - There are three kinds of resource types:

            1. Puppet core or built-in resource types:

                - Core or built-in resource types are the pre-built puppet resource types shipped with puppet software.
                - All of the core or built-in Puppet resource types are written and maintained by Puppet team.

            2. Puppet defined resource types:

                - Defined resource types are lightweight resource types written in Puppet declarative language using a combination of existing resource types.

            3. Puppet custom resource types:

                - Custom resource types are completely customized resource types written in Ruby.

        - In the terminal, type the following command to display a list of available inbuilt puppet resource types:

            $ puppet resource --types

        - To find out all the attributes associated with the puppet resource type, use the following command:

            $ puppet describe <resource type name>

===========================
    - Puppet Classes:
===========================

        - A combination of different resources can be grouped together into a single unit called class.
        - Puppet introduced classes to make the structure re-usable and organized.
        - Classes are defined inside of Puppet Manifests
        - Classes are not applied unless invoked by name
        - Classes can be parameterized and parameters can be passed through variables

        - Syntax:

                class <class-name> {
                <Resource declarations>
                }

        - classes must be unique and can be declared only once with the same name

        - Example:

                class ntpconfig {
                    file {
                        "/etc/ntp.conf":
                     ensure=> "present", content=> "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n",
                    }
                }

        - Class variables

            - Variables are actually constants in Puppet and can not be reassigned once defined
            - The default data type of variables in Puppet is any but can be changed and be definite such as String or Numbers
            - Dollar($) symbol is used to define a variable name

            - Example:

                Class one{
                    $cont = "value"
                    file {‘/home/filename.txt':
                    ensure => present,
                    content => $cont,
                    owner => "Naveen",
                    ...
                    }
                    }

        - Class Parameters:

            - To use external data in a class, parameters are used
            - It is used when class needs to configure itself with data other than the one gathered from facts
            - Parameters can be used as variables, but:

                - Can’t be set with assignment statement
                - Can not look up from top or node scope

            - Example:

                class base::linux (String $user = "root") {
                file { "etc/passwd":
                owner: "root",
                group: "root",
                mode: "0644",
                .....
                }
                }

                - Parameters are declared along with the class declaration
                - From the above example it is "(String $user = "root")"

        - Class Declaration:

            - From the above example, the code that we have written will never get executed unless we declare this class elsewhere.
            - To use a defined class in code, use the include keyword.

            - Example: demontp.pp

                class ntpconfig {
                file {
                    "/etc/ntp.conf":
                  ensure=> "present",
                  content=> "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n",
                }
                }
                include ntpconfig

            - check whether the code has any syntax errors. Execute the following command:

                $ puppet parser validate demontp.pp

===========================
    - Puppet Manifests:
============================

        - Manifest is a directory containing puppet DSL files (Ex: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests)
        - Manifests are puppet programs which are composed of puppet code
        - Those files have a .pp extension. The .pp extension stands for puppet program.
        - Manifests contain collection of resource declarations that are executed on a node
        - The puppet code consists of definitions or declarations of Puppet Classes.

        - Manifest file workflow:

            - Puppet manifest consists of the following components:

                - Files (these are plain files where Puppet has nothing to do with them, just to pick them up and place them in the target location)
                - Resources
                - Templates (these can be used to construct configuration files on the node)
                - Nodes (all the definition related to a client node is defined here)
                - Classes

            - In Puppet, all manifest files use Ruby as their encoding language and get saved with .pp extension.
            - "Import" statement in many manifest are used for loading files when Puppet starts
            - In order to import all files contained in a directory, you can use the import statement in another way like import 'clients/*'.
            - This will import all .pp files inside that directory.

        - Working with variables:

            - While writing a manifest, the user can define a new variable or use an existing variable at any point in a manifest.
            - Puppet supports different kind of variables but few of them are frequently used such as strings and array of string
            - Example: String Variable

                $package = "vim"
                package {  $package:
                ensure => "installed"
                }

        - Using Loops:

            - Loops are used when one wishes to go through multiple iterations on a same set of code till a defined condition is met.
            - They are also used to do repetitive tasks with different set of values.
            - Example: loop

                $packages = ['vim', 'git', 'curl']

                package { $packages:
                   ensure => "installed"
                }

        - Using Conditionals:

            - Puppet supports most of the conditional structure which can be found in traditional programming languages.
            - Condition can be used to dynamically define whether to perform a particular task or a set of code should get executed.
            - Example:

                if $OperatingSystem != 'Linux' {
                   warning('This manifest is not supported on this other OS apart from linux.')
                } else {
                   notify { 'the OS is Linux. We are good to go!': }
                }

        - Demo-1: Configure Agents using Manifests

            - Example: Install git package in the agentResources

                - create a file called "create_package.pp" under "/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/" and add the following content: (On Puppet Server)

                    node default{
                    package {"git": ensure => "present"}
                    exec {"apt-update": command => "/usr/bin/apt-get update"}
                    }

                - On Agent run the following command and check the result

                    $ puppet agent -t

                    root@puppet-agent-1:/etc/puppetlabs/puppet# puppet agent -t

==================================
    - Puppet Modules:
==================================

        - In Puppet, a module can be defined as a collection of manifests and data such as resources, classes, files, definition, and templates.
        - They have specific directory structure
        - They are the re-usable and sharable units in Puppet.
        - They have a very specific directory structure and are self contained pieces of code
        - Modules are the basic building blocks of puppet
        - The defined directory structure of Modules enables Puppet to find and load classes, types, facts, functions, tasks, automatically
        - The sub directories are not set and it is not necessary for every module to have every sub directory
        - Modules are stored in "/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/"
        - For example, the MySQL module to install and configure MySQL or the Jenkins module to manage Jenkins, etc..

        - Demo-2: Create a module on the puppet master

            - Pre-requisites:

                - Install Puppet Development Kit (PDK)
                - Here is the commands to download and configure PDK in ubuntu machine:

                    $ wget https://apt.puppet.com/puppet-tools-release-bionic.deb
                    $ sudo dpkg -i puppet-tools-release-bionic.deb
                    $ sudo apt-get update
                    $ sudo apt-get install pdk

            - To create a puppet module firstly create a separate directory where you can create custom modules

                $ cd /tmp/

                $ mkdir modules

            - Generate a module

                - Now create a new custom module using the puppet development kit

                    - Generates the basic components of a module and set up an infrastructure for testing it with PDK.

                        $ pdk new module <module-name>

                            - module-name should be followed by <username>-<module>

            - Generate a class

                - To generate the main class of the module, which is defined in an init.pp file, give the class the same name as the module.

                    $ pdk new class <class_name>

                        - PDK creates the new class manifest and a test file (as class_name_spec.rb) in your module's /spec/classes directory.

            - Now you can edit manifests in ModuleName/manifests folder

                - Note: init.pp file inside the manifests folder is executed whenever a module is called.
                - Edit the init.pp manifest

                    $ vi moduleName/manifests/init.pp

            - Validate the module

                $ pdk validate

                    - Command should be run inside the module folder

            - Now build the module

                $ pdk build [--target-dir=<PATH>] [--force]

            - Install the module on the master machine

                $ puppet module install <path to tar.gz build file>

            - Now, add the module to the site.pp file in the default manifest folder

                $ vi /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

                    class {'module_name':}

            - On the puppet agent test the catalog

                - Run the puppet agent test command to pull the catalog

                    $ /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent -t

            - Note: Since we changed the default index file of the apache2 localhost the change can be seen when we check the localhost on the web browser

                http://localhost/

            - Example:

                - Create a new custom module (Naveennb-apache)

                    root@puppet-master:/tmp# pdk new module my-apache
                    pdk (INFO): Creating new module: my-apache

                    We need to create the metadata.json file for this module, so we're going to ask you 4 questions.
                    If the question is not applicable to this module, accept the default option shown after each question. You can modify any answers at any time by manually updating the metadata.json file.

                    [Q 1/4] If you have a Puppet Forge username, add it here.
                    We can use this to upload your module to the Forge when it's complete.
                    --> naveennb

                    [Q 2/4] Who wrote this module?
                    This is used to credit the module's author.
                    --> Naveen

                    [Q 3/4] What license does this module code fall under?
                    This should be an identifier from https://spdx.org/licenses/. Common values are "Apache-2.0", "MIT", or "proprietary".
                    --> Apache-2.0

                    [Q 4/4] What operating systems does this module support?
                    Use the up and down keys to move between the choices, space to select and enter to continue.
                    --> RedHat based Linux, Debian based Linux, Windows

                    Metadata will be generated based on this information, continue? Yes

=================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Catalog Compilation:

    - To configure a node, the Puppet Agent downloads a Catalog from the Puppet Server
    - Catalog holds the information of the desired state of each node
    - The Puppet Server Compiles the catalog from three main resources i.e. Manifests, Agent Provided Data, External Data

    - Fetch the node object:

        - After the puppet server receives the agent information, it asks for a configured node-terminus of a node
        - The node-terminus returns a node object which provides information on what all resources are required by Node

    - Set Variables:

        - All the variables from the node object, node facts, and the node certificate are collected and set as top-scope Puppet variable
        - Any manifest or template from then can use these variables for subsequent compilations

    - Assess the main Manifest:

        - Every node can specify a main manifest to use, otherwise the Puppet Server uses the main manifest from its config file.
        - The main manifest evaluates the node definitions and any code outside of node definition.

    - Load Classes from Modules:

        - Classes are loaded inside modules, but the main manifest can also contain the class definition
        - If the main manifests does not contain a class definition, Puppet automatically loads it from its collection of Modules

    - Assess classes from node Object:

        - After evaluating the main manifest and all the declared classes in it
        - Nodes matched in the node definitions have their classes evaluated at the node scope i.e. accessing the node scope variables set by the main manifests.

Node Classification:

    - Node classification is done to assign classes, parameters, and variables to nodes
    - Node Groups are created and then Nodes are added to these groups
    - Nodes can be added manually or according to set rules dynamically

Puppet Environment

    - Puppet Environments enables users to categorize systems based on some pre defined criteria such as status(Development, Test, Production, etc.)
    - Configuration can be set up according to environments and servers can be provisioned accordingly
    - Puppet enables users to have different sources for modules and manifests for different environments
