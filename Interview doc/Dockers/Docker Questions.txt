Docker Questions !!


What is Docker? Why we use Dockers?
Can I use json instead of yaml compose file in dockers?
Can you give commands for creating and stopping the container in dockers?
Why containerization?
What is the mean of Docker?
What are containers?
Ans. Containers are form of lightweight virtualization, heavier than ‘chroot’ but lighter than ‘hypervisors’. They provide isolation among processes while using same kernel as the host machine, and ‘cgroups’ functionality within kernel.
what is container?
difference between VMWARE and Container?
where you are used Dockers? why you are using Dockers?
what do you mean by container?
what was the product you deployed in kubernets?
how many nodes and how many masters are there in your kubernets?
what is your Docker environment?
what is the docker methodology you are using to geth the containers deployement?
explain me about the build complete life cycle How eactly build start in your organization and how it's build and how it's get deployeed?

1) difference between add and copy ?

COPY it helps to do the simple copy operation
Ex: 
COPY mydata.tar /tmp/
Inside container:
# ls -l /tmp/
Output: mydata.tar

ADD it helps to extract the data i.e., if you are giving .tar,.gz files as part of the ADD instruction then it will automatically extract the content. Hence you need to give seperate untar or unzip command to extract the data. 
Ex: 
ADD mydata.tar /tmp/
Inside container:
# ls -l /tmp/
Output: mydata

2) difference between CMD and entry point ?

ENTRYPOINT: command to run when container starts.
CMD: command to run when container starts or arguments to ENTRYPOINT if specified.

3) what is the ADD command ?
The ADD command is used to copy files/directories into a Docker image. It can copy data in three ways: Copy files from the local storage to a destination in the Docker image. Copy a tarball from the local storage and extract it automatically inside a destination in the Docker image.
 
4) what is docker file ?
 
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.
 
5) how to check how many containers are running ?
docker ps | grep imagename | wc -l

6) docker logging driver ?
Docker includes multiple logging mechanisms to help you get information from running containers and services. These mechanisms are called logging drivers. Each Docker daemon has a default logging driver, which each container uses unless you configure it to use a different logging driver.

7) what is difference between bridge network and custom bridge network?
 
a bridge network uses a software bridge which allows containers connected to the same bridge network to communicate, while providing isolation from containers which are not connected to that bridge network.
User-defined bridge networks are created and configured using docker network create . If different groups of applications have different network requirements, you can configure each user-defined bridge separately, as you create it. Linked containers on the default bridge network share environment variables.

8) difference between  overlay network and host network ?
 
Host networks are best when the network stack should not be isolated from the Docker host, but you want other aspects of the container to be isolated. 
 
Overlay networks are best when you need containers running on different Docker hosts to communicate, or when multiple applications work together using swarm services.
 
9) what is port forwarding in docker what is the use of it ? 
Port forwarding works for localhost ; --publish , -p , or -P all work. Ports exposed from Linux are forwarded to the host. 
recommendation is to publish a port, or to connect from another container.

10) how to login/enter to a container? 
docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

11) what is docker  system prune and docker image prune?
The docker image prune command allows you to clean up unused images. By default, docker image prune only cleans up dangling images.
The basic usage of the command docker system prune is Remove unused data. Removes all unused containers, networks, images 

12) how many types of volumes are there in Docker? (Local and network)
Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
Categories of data storage:
Non-persistent
Local storage
Data that is ephemeral (short term data)
Every container has it
Tied to the lifecycle of the contain
 
Persistent
Volumes
Volumes are decoupled from containers
 
13) How to check image vulnerability ? 
The easiest way to find vulnerabilities in Docker images is to run inspection against them using tools like or :
Anchore Engine: Anchore is a centralized service for inspection, analysis and certification of container image. ...
Clair: Clair is a static analyzer developed by CoreOS for Docker and APPC containers.
Twistlock: is one of  the tool which help to scan the docker images
